Thanks for visiting my page! I'm actively looking for amazing people to
pursue startup ideas together. I'll be writing an essay about "who am I" and
"where am I going". If you think we should know each other, we probably should!
Please drop me a message at hebi@lihebi.com, and let's rock the world!

## Program Analysis

Summer 2015 - Spring 2018

I was researching in Program Language and Analysis. We designed an
on-demand dynamic analysis framework.

## USTC RoboGame

2012 Summer

I was the leader of a team in USTC RoboGame 2012, and we ranked 3rd among 26
teams. The robot precisely fetched a bunch of flowers, found routes using image
processing, climbing the ladders, and finally put the followers precisely in
front of the sculpture of Jici Yan. You can see [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0EbvINeiy4][a small video]] of our robot in
the competition that day. Check out the [[file:assets/robogame2012-proposal.pdf][proposal (pdf, chinese)]] and the
[[file:assets/robogame2012-technical-report.pdf][technical report (pdf, chinese)]].
